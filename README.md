## My D&Dragons

This app will be my first self made project where I use React to create my webpage. Previous projects have for the most part been given as part of a course or similar.

The goal with this app is that I can use this with my current or future dnd teams as an online source for sharing information between players and dungeon master.

Because of a currently limited experience with web development this will be mostly a training exercise for me to develop my skills. I will most likely not use a database at this point, which will likely limit the usefulness if not making it completely useless. Either way it will be a good start that I can in the future take to the next level.
If it turns out I would have to use a database, I will likely use static examples to simulate data.

I will also put some time into the estetics of the webpage because it is something that I would like to become much better at.

If there are simple things I can add/alter I am open to suggestions as it will help me learn.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
